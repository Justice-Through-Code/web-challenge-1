# HTML Boilerplate

## Web Challenge 1

Your first HTML Challenge! 

After reading The Odin Project's Introduction to [HTML Boilerplate](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate), follow along with the video in its **Assignment** section to create your own boilerplate HTML file!

**NOTE**: This challenge (and following HTML/CSS challenges) will work a little differently than the others, as testing HTML/CSS works a little differently than testing Python code. Follow the steps below in the [Summary](#summary) section to complete and turn in this challenge.

### Estimated Time to Complete
